# Meta Certification Capstone
### Required capstone project for the Meta Front-End Developer Certificate

The repository was made to display the entire front-end development process required to creating a website for an imaginary restaurant called Little Lemon.  It includes wireframes and prototypes from the planning phase and code in HTML, CSS, and React.js for the actual website.  The website is comprised of the home page, booking page, and a confirmation page after a reservation has been set.
